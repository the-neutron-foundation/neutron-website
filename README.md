# The Neutron Programming Language
---

**Neutron is a high level general-purpose programming language that is inspired by C, Python, and Java.**
For now, only an interpreter has been implemented. There are plans to implement a compiler and it is [discussed here](https://github.com/the-neutron-foundation/neutron-language/issues/4)

# Example

```neutron
import "io";
io::print("Hello, World!")
```
