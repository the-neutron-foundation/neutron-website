Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Is the Neutron language compiled python (e.g. pyinstaller) or
interpreted python?** **BOTH!!** The releases are the executable format,
but the source is in Python. This means that you can run Neutron using
the `python3` command OR use the executable file. We use
[Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html) to convert the python
code into an executable.

**Why Should I use Neutron?** The main reason is because it has more
features (even more coming soon) than python 3, including Numpy Arrays
built-in, and because it is extremely configurable.
