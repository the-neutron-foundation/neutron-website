File Package
============

The `file` package deals with the reading and writing of files.

`file/file`
-----------

`file(filename)` is a file object with the methods: `read`, `write` and
`append`. The [filename]{.title-ref} (string) should (for now) be the
absolute path of the file you wish to read/write to.

`file/file::read()`
-------------------

`file(filename)::read()` reads the file given and returns the contents
of that file. It takes no arguments

`file/file::write()`
--------------------

`file(filename)::write(text)` write to a file and returns nothing
(`NullType`). It takes the argument of what to write to that file.

`file/file::append()`
---------------------

`file(filename)::append(text)` append to an existing file and returns
nothing (`NullType`). It takes the argument of what to append to that
file.
