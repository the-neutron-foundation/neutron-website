Random Package
==============

Random is a core built-in module. It is responsible for randomness!

`random/randrange`
------------------

`randrange(start, end)` pseudo-randomly generates integers between the
`start` and `end` arguments. It is based off of the python `randrange`
function.

`random/random`
---------------

`random()` pseudo-randomly generates a float between 0 and 1, and
returns it.
