Utils Package
=============

This package is responsible for all the functions that have to do with
list, tuples, and Numpy arrays.

`utils/len`
-----------

`len(obj)` gets the length (total number of items) of a list, tuple, or
Numpy array (passed as the `obj` argument) and returns it as a
`IntType`, given an argument.

`utils/range`
-------------

`range(start, end)` returns a `ListType` ranging from two arguments
(`start`, `end`) similar to that of python (the `range()` function in
python but it takes 2 arguments)
