Operators
=========
---

There are many operators on different types in neutron. You can use
parentheses for grouping.

Math
----

Note that with math, order of operations is applied.

`+` - add two values together

`-` - subtract two values

`/` - divide first value by second value

`*` - multiply two values together

`%` - get remainder of division (modulo operation)

Logic
-----

The order of which logic operations are applied are: `!`, `&`, `|`

`!` - NOT operation: return true if false and false if true

`&` - AND operation: return true if both values are true otherwise
return false

`|` - OR operation: return true if both values or one value is true,
otherwise false
