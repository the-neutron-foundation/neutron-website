Loops
=====
---

While Loops
-----------

While loops are like while loops in python. They keep on looping until a
certain condition is false. This condition is put in parentheses and the
code that is to be run is but in curly braces. Example:

```neutron
x = 0;  // Declare variable x
while (x < 10) {  // Check if x is greater than 10, if so, break out of loop
  x += 1;
}
// now x == 10
```

For Loops
---------

For loops are just like for loops in python. They iterate through an
object, and repeat until the object \"over\". Neutron uses the `in`
keyword for its iteration. Example:

```neutron
list_thing = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
for i in list_thing {
  // do something with i
}
```

Break Statements
----------------

To break out of a loop, simply use the `break` keyword. Example:

```neutron
while (true) {
  break;
}

for i in foo {
  break;
}
```

Make sure not to break inside a program or an area that is not a loop.
Doing so may result in glitches and errors. Note that if you have nested
while loops, `break` will break out of the one that it is put in. A
break statement can also be used in a function, and if called in a loop,
will break out of it. Example:

```neutron
func break_func() {
  break;
}

while (true) {
  break_func(); // Breaks out of loop
}
```
