Collection Types
================
---

These types store a collection of primitive types, objects, and even
collection types!

`NumpyArray`
------------

This type is the same as the Numpy `ndarray()` class. This is built in
and every object in the array is separated by commas. All of that is
around a pair of brackets.

```neutron
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);  // Evaluates to Numpy Array
```

`ListType`
----------

This type is the same as the Python list class. This is built in and
every object in the list is separated by commas. All of that is around a
pair of square brackets.

```neutron
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  // Evaluates to python list
```

`TupleType`
-----------

This type is the same as the Python tuple class. This is built in and
every object in the tuple is separated by commas. All of that is around
a pair of curly brackets.

```neutron
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Evaluates to python tuple
```
