Variables
=========
---

Variables in Neutron are simple and elegant to use, like in python. You
do not need to define the type the the variable is.

Variable Assignment
-------------------

To declare a variable in the local scope, put the name of the variable,
an equals sign, and the value of the variable, and a semi-colon,
of-course. Example:

```neutron
variable_here = 102;  // Make variable with name "variable_here" and value 102
```

Getting Variable Value
----------------------

To get the value of a variable, just type in the name of the variable.
Example:

```neutron
hello = "Hello, World";  // Make variable with name "hello" and value "Hello, World"
hello;  // Evaluates to "Hello, World"
```

Assignment Operators
--------------------

You can add, subtract, multiply, divide, or modulo a variable, with out
using the `x = x + 1;` idiom. You use the `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and
`%=` operator. For example:

```neutron
x = 1;
x += 1000; // x is now 1001
x -= 1000; // x is now 1 again
x *= 3; // x is now 3
x /= 2; // x is now 1 (integer division)
y = 13;
y %= 10; // y is now 3 (because 13 % 10 is 3)
```
