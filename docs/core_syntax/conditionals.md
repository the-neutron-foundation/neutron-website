Conditionals
============
---

Conditionals work around the same in python.

If
--

If statements use the `if` keyword, followed by the condition in
parentheses, followed by the code to run. Example:

```neutron
if (true) {
  // run code here
}
```

Else If
-------

Else if statements use the `else` and `if` keyword, followed by the
condition in parentheses, followed by the code to run. They go after if
statements and are run if the previous if statement evaluated to
`false`. Note the python `elif` keyowrd does not work. Example:

```neutron
if (false) {
  // code that won't run
} else if (true) {
  // run code here
}
```

Else
----

Else if statements also go after if or else if statements, and are run
when everything before it evaluated to false. They do not need a
condition and use the `else` keyword. Example:

```neutron
if (false) {
  // code that won't run
} else if (false) {
  // code that won't run
} else {
  // code that will run
}
```
