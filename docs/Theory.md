Design Principles
-----------------

*   **Be easy to read.** Neutron has been designed to be easy to read,
    and easy to learn. It is similar to Python 3, making it easier to
    learn for those who know the language. It also does not use newlines
    ([Off-side Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule)) which
    makes it easier to learn for people coming from languages like C and
    C++.
*   **Have a consistent syntax.** Neutron\'s syntax was designed to be
    elegant and consistent. It does **not** have many
    exceptions/inconsistencies as far as syntax is concerned.
*   **Be different.** You might be thinking, why would I ever use this
    over Python? It\'s just another language to learn, and it provides
    the same features as a lot of other programming languages. That\'s
    where your wrong. Neutron is going to have **C-like structs, switch
    statements, and more**. Oh, and also it has **built-in Numpy
    support** and **built-in functions**.
*   **Cutting Edge is more important than speed**. Usability and cutting edge
    features are more important than speed.

Neutron's "Conventions"
-----------------------

```poem
Lowercase Variables, Functions, And Class Names, With Underscores
semicolons at the end of each line
indexing starts at the most natural number, 0;
break statements are allowed in functions; [0]
inline python code is truer than true; [1] break
built_in numpy arrays a real, real, real; [2] break `#python`
__? More like -- in neutron, because no shift key is needed; [3] break `#python` (1, 2, 3)
neutron; [4] break `#python` (1, 2, 3) --
cutting Edge is more important than speed;
```
