Design Principles
=================
---

-   **Be easy to read.** Neutron has been designed to be easy to read,
    and easy to learn. It is similar to Python 3, making it easier to
    learn for those who know the language. It also does not use newlines
    ([Off-side Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule)) which
    makes it easier to learn for people coming from languages like C and
    C++.
-   **Have a consistent syntax.** Neutron\'s syntax was designed to be
    elegant and consistent. It does **not** have many
    exceptions/inconsistencies as far as syntax is concerned.
-   **Be different.** You might be thinking, why would I ever use this
    over Python? It\'s just another language to learn, and it provides
    the same features as a lot of other programming languages. That\'s
    where your wrong. Neutron is going to have **C-like structs, switch
    statements, and more**. Oh, and also it has **built-in Numpy
    support** and **built-in functions**.
